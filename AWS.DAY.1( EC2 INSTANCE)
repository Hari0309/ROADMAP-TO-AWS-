Q= What is EC2, and why is it important?
EC2 Service is mostly used services in AWS.
EC2 = ELASTIC CLOUD COMPUTE ( HARDWARE WITH OPERATING SYSTEM IS CALLED EC2 )
= Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
-  Access reliable, scalable infrastructure on demand. Scale capacity within minutes with SLA commitment of 99.99% availability.
-  Provide secure compute for your applications. Security is built into the foundation of Amazon EC2 with the AWS Nitro System.
-  Optimize performance and cost with flexible options like AWS Graviton-based instances, Amazon EC2 Spot instances, and AWS Savings Plans.


EC2 usecases
= Deliver secure, reliable, high-performance, and cost-effective compute infrastructure to meet demanding business needs.
  Access the on-demand infrastructure and capacity you need to run HPC applications faster and cost-effectively.
  Access environments in minutes, dynamically scale capacity as needed, and benefit from AWS’s pay-as-you-go pricing.
  Deliver the broadest choice of compute, networking (up to 400 Gbps), and storage services purpose-built to optimize price performance for ML projects


EC2 Instance Types:-

General purpose

General Purpose instances are designed to deliver a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. They are suitable for a wide range of applications, including web servers,
small databases, development and test environments, and more.

Compute optimized

Compute Optimized instances provide a higher ratio of compute power to memory. They excel in workloads that require high-performance processing such as batch processing, 
scientific modeling, gaming servers, and high-performance web servers.

Memory optimized

Memory Optimized instances are designed to handle memory-intensive workloads. They are suitable for applications that require large amounts of memory, such as in-memory databases,
real-time big data analytics, and high-performance computing.

Storage optimized

Storage Optimized instances are optimized for applications that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets. 
They are ideal for tasks like data warehousing, log processing, and distributed file systems.

Accelerated computing

Accelerated Computing Instances typically come with one or more types of accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs),
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), or custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). 
These accelerators offload computationally intensive tasks from the main CPU, enabling faster and more efficient processing for specific workloads.

             DAY 1 HOW TO CREATE EC2 INSTANCE IN AWS AND LOGIN TO PUTTY.

# LOGIN TO AWS CONSLOE
= CLICK ON EC2 DASHBOARD
= CLICK ON LUNCH INSTANCE
= NAME : you can give any name
= OS :  select as per your requirement (ubuntu)
= INSTANCE TYPE: select free tier 
= CREATE KEY PAIR: Create new keypair, any name 
= SELECT PPK : for putty login select ppk
= CREATE KEY PAIR
= Network : Click on edit  
= vpc : select by default
= subnet : select by default
= security : Create security group 
= Enable auto asign public ip
= SELECT NO OF INSTANCE: select 1 or 2.
= CLICK ON LUNCH INSTANCE
# OUR INSTANCE IS READY NOW WE HAVE TO OPEN THE TERMINAL.
= OPEN YOUR PUTTY
= HOSTNAME : enter the public ip of your instance
= click on (+) sign button near SSH
= click on auth
= click on browse
= SELECT YOUR KEYFILE: you created before ( check line no.9 for reference)
= cLICK ON OPEN
= CLICK ON ACCEPT 
# NOW YOUR TERMINAL IS READY
= login as : ec2user
************ we sucessfully created ec2 and login to terminal using putty**********
